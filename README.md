# HANGMAN-GAME- 
Classic Hangman game built with Python. Guess letters, solve the word, and avoid the full stick figure! Features randomized words, ASCII art visuals, and a clean CLI interface. Great for beginners to learn loops, conditionals, and string logic. Fun, educational, and easy to expand!
